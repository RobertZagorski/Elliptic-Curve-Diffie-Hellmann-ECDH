# Elliptic-Curve-Diffie-Hellmann-ECDH
A Java implementation of Diffie-Hellmann Algorithm based on Elliptic Curves

This is a sample project that presents functioning of Diffie-Hellman algorithm on elliptic curves.
Operations in GF2 had been self-made.
In the file out/parametry.txt are presented sample cryptographically safe curves taken from NIST documents which are working for this project
